Todo pre 1.0.8
   . Implement strip_metadata option.
   . This is the release where I pull in all the other ideas and tests I can
     URLs to look at are:
       . http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras <- Have a look at
         these..
       . http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2007-February/000543.html
           Look at regex speedups!
   
Todo pre 1.0.9:
   . Document the markdown (and multimarkdown) syntaxes in the module
   . Make markdown / multimarkdown / stolen from the php version features 
     configurable at instance create time. (There should be an elegant way to 
     do this, but I can't think of it offhand).
     
Todo pre 1.0.10:
   . Using configurable features, borg the Text::Markdown module, giving it a 
     test suite and a maintainer.
     
Todo pre 1.1:
   . Build a parse tree when parsing (which can be returned), rather than just 
     using strings. This would make the output format much more flexible, and
     would remove a load of nasty hacks which escape, then un-escape things
     again whist processing..
