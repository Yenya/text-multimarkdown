Todo pre 1.0.8
    . Make all the tests pass again..

Todo pre 1.0.9:
    . Make markdown / multimarkdown / stolen from the php version features 
      configurable at instance create time. (There should be an elegant way to 
      do this, but I can't think of it offhand).
    . Using configurable features, borg the Text::Markdown module, giving it a 
      test suite and a maintainer.

Todo pre 1.0.10:
   . Have a look at extra features in 
     http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras and put anything 
     we consider useful on the roadmap.
   . Integrate maruku (ruby port) test cases properly, and go looking for 
     more.
   . Have a look at the php markdown extra tests to see if we want to steal 
     any of those features.
   . Document the markdown (and multimarkdown) syntaxes in the module
     
Todo pre 1.1:
   . Build a parse tree when parsing (which can be returned), rather than just 
     using strings. This would make the output format much more flexible, and
     would remove a load of nasty hacks which escape, then un-escape things
     again whist processing..
