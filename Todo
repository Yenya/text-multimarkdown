Todo pre 1.0.8:
   . Document the markdown (and multimarkdown) syntaxes in the module
   . Make markdown / multimarkdown / stolen from the php version features 
     configurable at instance create time. (There should be an elegant way to 
     do this, but I can't think of it offhand).
     
Todo pre 1.0.9:
   . Using configurable features, borg the Text::Markdown module, giving it a 
     test suite and a maintainer.
     
Todo pre 1.1:
   . Build a parse tree when parsing (which can be returned), rather than just 
     using strings. This would make the output format much more flexible, and
     would remove a load of nasty hacks which escape, then un-escape things
     again whist processing..
