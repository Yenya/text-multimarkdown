Todo pre 1.0.6
   . Implement strip_metadata option
   . Tests: auto links (email addressen)
   . Tests: Backslash escapes of markdown features (all of!)
   . Do not be seeding the random number generator on each page generation.
   . Look at the failing test cases (especially the Lists one) and see if  
     fixable easily.
   . Document other metadata / global options (e.g. bibliography title)
   . Look at (and fix if needed) Text::Markdown's RT#27482.
   
Todo pre 1.0.7:
   . Document the markdown (and multimarkdown) syntaxes in the module
   . Make markdown / multimarkdown / stolen from the php version features 
     configurable at instance create time. (There should be an elegant way to 
     do this, but I can't think of it offhand).
   . Make 21fulldocs-markdown.t pass without TODO.
     
Todo pre 1.0.8:
   . Using configurable features, borg the Text::Markdown module, giving it a 
     test suite and a maintainer.
     
Todo pre 1.1:
   . Build a parse tree when parsing (which can be returned), rather than just 
     using strings. This would make the output format much more flexible, and
     would remove a load of nasty hacks which escape, then un-escape things
     again whist processing..
